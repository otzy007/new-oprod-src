Who am I?
---------
A Freelancer Developer and a Linux Geek :p

Most of the time I write code in Ruby and C/C++. But there are times when I use other things such as: Java, Bash, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Ruby on Rails and whatever I need to get my job done ;)

You can see a part of my work on this website and on Github at: https://github.com/otzy007
