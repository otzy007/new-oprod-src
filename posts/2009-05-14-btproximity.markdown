<p>I modified a script to work also in [[KDE]] 4. The script uses bluetooth to search for the phone, if the phone is too far the computer will be locked.</p>

<p>When you come back to the computer, it will be unlocked. Remember to edit your phones mac address in the script and also to pair your phone with the computer. You can download the script from <a href="http://drop.io/ozfiles/asset/btproximity">my dropio</a> or from the <a href="index.php/downloads/category/1-btproximity" target="_self">Downloads page</a>. Or copy it from here:</p>
