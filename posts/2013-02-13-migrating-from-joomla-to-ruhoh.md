It's about time to migrate the site from the old Joomla 1.5 CMS to a new one.
So I've choosed [ruhoh](http://ruhoh.com/) instead of upgrading to a new Joomla
version because ruhoh generates a static website that I can easily host it almost
anywhere without the need of a database or some server side scripting. Right now
it's hosted on GitHub.

Now oprod.net website is still under development, it still needs a new downloads
page and some minor design things.

So... Welcome to the new website.
