<p>Here's a small shell server written in Java by me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It has basic features such as: ls, cd, head, mv, cp and also: get and put, to get/put files on the server.</p>
<p><strong>Please note that this application is not safe to use because it doesn't use encryption or authentication.</strong></p>
<p>To connect to the server you can use Putty with a raw connection or netcat:</p>
<p>nc host 8100</p>
<p>To use "get" or "put" for file transfer you must first type put or get followed by the name of the file and then connect to port 8101 using nc.</p>
<p>For get: nc host 8101 &gt; file</p>
<p>For put: nc host 8101 &lt; get</p>
<p> </p>
