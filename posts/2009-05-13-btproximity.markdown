<p>I modified a script to work also in [[KDE]] 4. The script uses [[bluetooth]] to search for the phone, if the phone is too far the computer will be locked. When you come back to the computer, it will be unlocked. Remeber to edit your phones [[mac]] address in the script and also to pair your phone with the computer. You can download the script from <a href="http://oprod.net/index.php/downloads/category/1-btproximity">here</a>. Or copy it from here:</p>

# Copied from Steven on http://gentoo-wiki.com/Talk:TIP_Bluetooth_Proximity_Monitor

# These are the sections you'll need to edit

 # You'll need to use the MAC address of your phone here
DEVICE="00:21:FB:11:6A:E5"

# How often to check the distance between phone and computer in seconds
CHECK_INTERVAL=2

# The RSSI threshold at which a phone is considered far or near
THRESHOLD=-10

# The command to run when your phone gets too far away
