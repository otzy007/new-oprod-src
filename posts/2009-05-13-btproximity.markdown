<p>I modified a script to work also in [[KDE]] 4. The script uses [[bluetooth]] to search for the phone, if the phone is too far the computer will be locked. When you come back to the computer, it will be unlocked. Remeber to edit your phones [[mac]] address in the script and also to pair your phone with the computer. You can download the script from <a href="http://oprod.net/index.php/downloads/category/1-btproximity">here</a>. Or copy it from here:</p>
